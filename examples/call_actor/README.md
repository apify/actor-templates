# My beautiful actor

The `README.md` file contains a documentation what your actor does and how to use it,
which is then displayed in the app or Apify Store. It's always a good
idea to write a good `README.md`, in a few months not even you
will remember all the details about the actor.

You can use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet)
language for rich formatting.
