title: Puppeteer with proxy
---

 This example demonstrates how to load pages in headless Chrome / Puppeteer
 over [Apify Proxy](https://docs.apify.com/proxy).
 To make it work, you'll need an Apify account with access to the proxy.
 Visit the [Apify platform introduction](/docs/guides/apify-platform) to find
 how to log into your account from the SDK.

 > To run this example on the Apify Platform, select the `Node.js 12 + Chrome on Debian (apify/actor-node-chrome)` 
 >base image on the **Source** tab when configuring the actor.
