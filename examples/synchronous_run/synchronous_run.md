title: Synchronous run
---

 This example shows a quick actor that has a run time of just a few seconds.
 It opens a [web page](http://goldengatebridge75.org/news/webcam.html)
 that contains a webcam stream from the Golden Gate Bridge, takes a screenshot of the page and saves it as output.

 This actor can be invoked synchronously using a single HTTP request to directly obtain its output
  as a response, using the
 [Run actor synchronously](https://apify.com/docs/api/v2#/reference/actors/run-actor-synchronously/without-input)
 Apify API endpoint. The example is also shared as the
 [`apify/example-golden-gate-webcam`](https://apify.com/apify/example-golden-gate-webcam)
 actor in the Apify library, so you can test it directly there simply by sending a POST request to
 ```http
 https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/apify~example-golden-gate-webcam/run-sync?token=[YOUR_API_TOKEN]
 ```

 To run this example on the Apify Platform, select the `Node.js 12 + Chrome on Debian (apify/actor-node-chrome)` base image
 on the source tab of your actor configuration.

```javascript
const Apify = require('apify');

Apify.main(async () => {
    // Launch web browser.
    const browser = await Apify.launchPuppeteer({ headless: true });

    // Load http://goldengatebridge75.org/news/webcam.html and get an IFRAME with the webcam stream
    console.log('Opening web page...');
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto('http://goldengatebridge75.org/news/webcam.html');
    const frames = await page.frames();
    const iframeWithVideo = frames[1];

    // Wait for the webcam to load.
    console.log('Waiting for the webcam image.');
    const imageElementHandle = await iframeWithVideo.waitForSelector('.VideoColm img[src^="blob:"]');
    // Wait a little more to give the browser a chance to display the image.
    await page.waitFor(1000);

    // Get a screenshot of that image.
    const imageBuffer = await imageElementHandle.screenshot();
    console.log('Screenshot captured.');

    // Save the screenshot as the actor's output. By convention, similarly to "INPUT",
    // the actor's output is stored in the default key-value store under the "OUTPUT" key.
    await Apify.setValue('OUTPUT', imageBuffer, { contentType: 'image/jpeg' });
    console.log('Actor finished.');
});
```
