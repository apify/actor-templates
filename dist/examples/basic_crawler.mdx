This is the most bare-bones example of the Apify SDK, which demonstrates some of its
building blocks such as the [`BasicCrawler`](/docs/api/basic-crawler).
You probably don't need to go this deep though, and it would be better to start
with one of the full featured crawlers like
[`CheerioCrawler`](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/examples/cheerio-crawler) or
[`PlaywrightCrawler`](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/examples/playwright-crawler).

The script simply downloads several web pages with plain HTTP requests using the
[`Apify.utils.requestAsBrowser()`](/docs/api/utils#requestasbrowser)
convenience function and stores their raw HTML and URL in the default dataset.
In local configuration, the data will be stored as JSON files in `./apify_storage/datasets/default`.
