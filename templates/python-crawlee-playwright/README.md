## Python Crawlee with Playwright template

A template for [web scraping](https://apify.com/web-scraping) data from websites starting from provided URLs using Python. The starting URLs are passed through the Actor's input schema, defined by the [input schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/input-schema). The template uses [Crawlee for Python](https://crawlee.dev/python) for efficient web crawling, making requests via headless browser managed by [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/), and handling each request through a user-defined handler that uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) API to extract data from the page. Enqueued URLs are managed in the [request queue](https://crawlee.dev/python/api/class/RequestQueue), and the extracted data is saved in a [dataset](https://crawlee.dev/python/api/class/Dataset) for easy access.
