```bash
apify run
```

## Deploy to Apify

### Connect Git repository to Apify

If you've created a Git repository for the project, you can easily connect to Apify:

1. Go to [Actor creation page](https://console.apify.com/actors/new)
2. Click on **Link Git Repository** button

### Push project on your local machine to Apify

You can also deploy the project on your local machine to Apify without the need for the Git repository.

1. Log in to Apify. You will need to provide your [Apify API Token](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations) to complete this action.

    ```bash
    apify login
    ```

2. Deploy your Actor. This command will deploy and build the Actor on the Apify Platform. You can find your newly created Actor under [Actors -> My Actors](https://console.apify.com/actors?tab=my).

    ```bash
    apify push
    ```
