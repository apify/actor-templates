## Python LlamaIndex Agent Template

Create a new [AI Agent](https://blog.apify.com/what-are-ai-agents) with [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) using this template.
It provides a basic structure for the Agent with the Apify SDK and allows you to easily add your own functionality.

## Included features

- **[Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/)** for Python - a toolkit for building Apify [Actors](https://apify.com/actors) and scrapers in Python.
- **[Input Schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/input-schema)** - define and easily validate a schema for your Actor's input.
- **[LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)** - a framework for building LLM-powered agents using your data.
- **[Dataset](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/docs/concepts/storages#working-with-datasets)** - a storage solution for structured data where each object stored shares the same attributes.

## How it works

The Agent has two main tools:

1. `call_contact_details_scraper` - Calls the [Contact Details Scraper](https://apify.com/vdrmota/contact-info-scraper) to scrape contact details from websites.
2. `summarize_contact_information` - Summarizes the collected contact details.

Given a user query with a URL, the Agent uses the Contact Details Scraper to retrieve the contact information and optionally summarizes the data.
The Agent can decide how to handle the dataâ€”whether to process it further or skip summarization if it's not necessary.

### Sample queries:
- Find contact details for `apify.com` and provide raw results.
- Find contact details for `apify.com` and summarize them.

## Before you start

To run this template locally or on the Apify platform, you need:

- An [Apify account](https://console.apify.com/) and an [Apify API token](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/api#api-token).
- An [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) account and API key.

## Monetization

This template uses the [Pay Per Event](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing/monetize#pay-per-event-pricing-model) (PPE) monetization model, which provides flexible pricing based on defined events.

To charge users, define events in JSON format and save them on the Apify platform. Here is an example of [pay_per_event.json](.actor/pay_per_event.json) with the `task-completed` event:

```json
[
    {
        "task-completed": {
            "eventTitle": "Task completed",
            "eventDescription": "Cost per query answered.",
            "eventPriceUsd": 0.1
        }
    }
]
```

In the Actor, trigger the event with:

```javascript
await Actor.charge({ eventName: 'task-completed' });
```

This approach allows you to programmatically charge users directly from your Actor, covering the costs of execution and related services, such as LLM input/output tokens.
