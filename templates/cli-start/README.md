# Actor CLI starter template

Start a new Actorization project quickly and easily with this project template. It provides a basic structure for building an Actor with the [Apify CLI](https://docs.apify.com/cli) and allows you to easily add your own functionality.

## Included features

- **[Apify CLI](https://docs.apify.com/cli/)** - toolkit for building [Actors](https://apify.com/actors) that interact with the [Apify platform](https://docs.apify.com/platform/).
- **[jq](https://jqlang.org/)** - a command line filter for working with JSON

## How it works

This template is useful when you're already familiar with the [Apify Platform](https://docs.apify.com/platform/) and want to use the [Apify CLI](https://docs.apify.com/cli) to turn almost any project into an Actor.

## Resources

- [Actor development](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development) in Apify documentation - see especially the [actor.json](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-definition/actor-json) part
- [Actor whitepaper](https://whitepaper.actor) for a deep dive into the Actor computing model
