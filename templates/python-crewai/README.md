## Python CrewAI template

A template for [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) projects in Python for building AI agents with [Apify Actors](https://apify.com/actors). The template provides a basic structure and an example [agent](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents) that calls [Actors](https://apify.com/actors) as tools in a workflow.

For a detailed guide, visit the [How to build an AI agent](https://blog.apify.com/how-to-build-an-ai-agent/) article.

## How it works

An [agent](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents) is created and given a set of tools to accomplish a task. The agent receives a query from the user and decides which tools to use and in what order to complete the task. In this case, the agent is provided with an [Instagram Scraper Actor](https://apify.com/apify/instagram-scraper) to scrape Instagram profile posts. The agent produces textual output, which is saved to a dataset.

## How to use

Add or modify the agent tools in the `src/tools.py` file, and make sure to include new tools in the agent tools list in `src/main.py`. Additionally, you can update the agent prompts in `src/main.py`. For more information, refer to the [CrewAI agent documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents) and the [CrewAI tools documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/tools).

#### Pay Per Event

This template uses the [Pay Per Event (PPE)](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing/monetize#pay-per-event-pricing-model) monetization model, which provides flexible pricing based on defined events.

To charge users, define events in JSON format and save them on the Apify platform. Here is an example schema with the `task-completed` event:

```json
[
    {
        "task-completed": {
            "eventTitle": "Task completed",
            "eventDescription": "Cost per query answered.",
            "eventPriceUsd": 0.1
        }
    }
]
```

In the Actor, trigger the event with:

```python
await Actor.charge(event_name='task-completed')
```

This approach allows you to programmatically charge users directly from your Actor, covering the costs of execution and related services, such as LLM input/output tokens.

To set up the PPE model for this Actor:
- **Configure the OpenAI API key environment variable**: provide your OpenAI API key to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the Actor's **Environment variables**.
- **Configure Pay Per Event**: establish the Pay Per Event pricing schema in the Actor's **Admin settings**. First, set the **Pricing model** to `Pay per event` and add the schema. An example schema can be found in [pay_per_event.json](.actor/pay_per_event.json).

## Included features
