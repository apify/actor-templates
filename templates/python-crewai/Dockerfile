# First, specify the base Docker image.
# You can see the Docker images from Apify at https://hub.docker.com/r/apify/.
# You can also use any other image from Docker Hub.
# We are using Python 3.12 because 3.13 required compilation of the packages for the CrewAI setup.

# Second, copy just requirements.txt into the Actor image,
# since it should be the only file that affects the dependency installation in the next step,
# in order to speed up the build.
COPY --chown=myuser:myuser requirements.txt ./

# Install the packages specified in requirements.txt,
# print the installed Python version, pip version,
# and all installed packages with their versions for debugging.
RUN echo "Python version:" \
 && python --version \
 && echo "Pip version:" \

 && pip install uv \

 && echo "Installing dependencies with uv:" \
 && uv pip install --system -r requirements.txt \

# Next, copy the remaining files and directories with the source code.
# Since we do this after installing the dependencies, quick builds will be really fast
# for most source file changes.

# Use compileall to ensure the runnability of the Actor Python code.
RUN python3 -m compileall -q src/

# Specify how to launch the source code of your Actor.
# By default, the "python3 -m ." command is run.
