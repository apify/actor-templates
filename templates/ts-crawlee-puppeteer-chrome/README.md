## PuppeteerCrawler template

This template is a production-ready boilerplate for developing an [Actor](https://apify.com/actors) with `PuppeteerCrawler`. Use this to bootstrap your projects using the most up-to-date code.

> We decided to split Apify SDK into two libraries, Crawlee and Apify SDK v3. Crawlee will retain all the crawling and scraping-related tools and will always strive to be the best [web scraping](https://apify.com/web-scraping) library for its community. At the same time, Apify SDK will continue to exist, but keep only the Apify-specific features related to building actors on the Apify platform. Read the upgrading guide to learn about the changes.
