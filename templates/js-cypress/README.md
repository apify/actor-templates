## Cypress test template

Run your [Cypress tests](https://www.cypress.io/) on the Apify Platform effectively and easily. The template provides the necessary setup for running the Cypress tests. You can change the Cypress configuration in the input, which is defined by the [input schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/input-schema). The template uses [globby library](https://www.jsdocs.io/package/globby) to fetch the Cypress test files and run them within the Actor. The video recordings are stored in [Key-value store](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/key-value-store) and the comprehensive test results are stored in the [Dataset](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset).

## Included features

- **[Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/)** - toolkit for building [Actors](https://apify.com/actors)
- **[Input schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/input-schema)** - define and easily validate a schema for your Actor's input
- **[Dataset](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/docs/guides/result-storage#dataset)** - store structured data where each object stored has the same attributes
- **[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)** - JavaScript Component and E2E testing library

## How it works

You can easily run your tests on the Apify Platform, just copy-paste your test files into `cypress/e2e` folder. The tests' names need to end with `-spec.cy.js`.

You can also customize the test run by specifying other options in the input, e.g. the screen size, video recording, or the default command timeout.

After running the tests, the Apify platform stores the results in a comprehensive way - datasets for JSON results, and key-value store for videos. You can view the results directly on the platform or download them to your local machine using a REST API.
