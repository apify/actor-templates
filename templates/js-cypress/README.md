# Cypress Test

Run your Cypress tests on the Apify Platform effectively and easily. Just set up your test environment using a user-friendly UI and let the platform do the rest.

## How to use

You can easily run your tests on Apify Platform, just copy-paste your test files into `Cypress -> e2e` folder. The tests' names need to end with `-spec.cy.js`.

You can also customize the test run by specifying other options in the settings, e.g. the screen size, video recording or the default command timeout.

After running the tests, the Apify Platform stores the results in a comprehensive way - datasets for json results, key value store for videos. You can view the results directly on the platform or download them to your local machine using a REST API.
