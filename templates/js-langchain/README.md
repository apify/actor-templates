## LangChain.js template

> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.
> 

This example template illustrates how to use LangChain.js with Apify to crawl the web data, vectorize them, and prompt the OpenAI model. All of this is within a single Apify Actor and slightly over a hundred lines of code.

## Included features

- **[Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/)** - a toolkit for building [Actors](https://apify.com/actors)
- **[Input schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/input-schema)** - define and easily validate a schema for your actor's input
- **[Langchain.js](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs)** - a framework for developing applications powered by language models
- **[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)** - a powerful language model

## How it works

The code contains the following steps:

1. Crawls given website using [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor.
2. Vectorizes the data using the [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API.
3. Caches the vector index in the [key-value store](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/key-value-store) so that when you run Actor for the same website again, the cached data are used to speed it up.
4. Data are fed to the OpenAI model using [Langchain.js](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs), and a given query is asked.

## Before you start

To be able to run this template both locally and on the Apify platform, you need to:

- Have an [Apify account](https://console.apify.com/) and sign into it using `apify login` command in your terminal. Without this, you won't be able to run the required [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor to gather the data.
- Have an [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) account and an API key. This is needed for vectorizing the data and also to be able to prompt the OpenAI model.
    - When running locally store this as OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable (https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/vars#set-up-environment-variables-in-apify-console).
    - When running on Apify platform, you can simply paste this into the input field in the input UI.

## Production use

> This serves purely as an example of the whole pipeline.
> 

For production use, we recommend you to:

- Separate crawling, data vectorization, and prompting into separate Actors. This way, you can run them independently and scale them separately.
- Replace the local vector store with [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) or a similar database. See the [LangChain.js docs](https://js.langchain.com/docs/) for more information.
