# Empty JavaScript template

Start a new [web scraping](https://apify.com/web-scraping) project quickly and easily in JavaScript (Node.js) with our empty project template. It provides a basic structure for building an Actor with [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/) and allows you to easily add your own functionality.

## Included features

- **[Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/)** - toolkit for building [Actors](https://apify.com/actors)
- **[Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/)** - web scraping and browser automation library

## How it works

This template is useful when you're already familiar with the [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js) and [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/) and want to start with a clean slate. It does not include `puppeteer` or `playwright` so install them manually and update the Dockerfile if you need them.
