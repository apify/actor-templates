# Empty JavaScript Actor template

Empty starter Actor. A blank slate with minimal starting code. Useful for quick scripting without having to delete bunch of stuff from other templates.

## Getting Started

Start a new web scraping project quickly and easily in JavaScript (Node.js) with our empty project template. It provides a basic structure for the Actor with [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/) and allows you to easily add your own functionality.
