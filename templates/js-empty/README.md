# Empty project

This template is useful when you're already familiar with the [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js) and [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev) and want to start with a clean slate. It does not include `puppeteer` or `playwright` so install them manually and update the Dockerfile if you need them.


Start a new web scraping project quickly and easily in JavaScript (Node.js) with our empty project template. It provides a basic structure for the Actor with [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/) and allows you to easily add your own functionality.
