# Empty project

This template is useful when you're already familiar with the [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js) and [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev) and want to start with a clean slate. It does not include `puppeteer` or `playwright` so install them manually and update the Dockerfile if you need them.

> We decided to split Apify SDK into two libraries, [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev) and [Apify SDK v3](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js). Crawlee will retain all the crawling and scraping-related tools and will always strive to be the best web scraping library for its community. At the same time, Apify SDK will continue to exist, but keep only the Apify-specific features related to building actors on the Apify platform. Read the [upgrading guide](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js/docs/upgrading/upgrading-to-v3) to learn about the changes.
