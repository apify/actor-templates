## Empty Python template

Start a new [web scraping](https://apify.com/web-scraping) project quickly and easily in Python with our empty project template. It provides a basic structure for the [Actor](https://apify.com/actors) with [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/) and allows you to easily add your own functionality.

## Included features

- **[Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/)** for Python - a toolkit for building [Actors](https://apify.com/actors) and scrapers in Python
- **[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)** - library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files

## How it works

Insert your own code to `async with Actor:` block. You can use the [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/), [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) or any other Python library.
