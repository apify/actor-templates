## Empty Python template

Start a new [web scraping](https://apify.com/web-scraping) project quickly and easily in Python with our empty project template. It provides a basic structure for the [Actor](https://apify.com/actors) with [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/) and allows you to easily add your own functionality.
