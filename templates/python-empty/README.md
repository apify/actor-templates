## Empty Python template

Start a new [web scraping](https://apify.com/web-scraping) project quickly and easily in Python with our empty project template. It provides a basic structure for the [Actor](https://apify.com/actors) with [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/) and allows you to easily add your own functionality.

## Included features

- **[Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/)** for Python - a toolkit for building Apify [Actors](https://apify.com/actors) and scrapers in Python
- **[Input schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/input-schema)** - define and easily validate a schema for your Actor's input
- **[Request queue](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/docs/concepts/storages#working-with-request-queues)** - queues into which you can put the URLs you want to scrape
- **[Dataset](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/docs/concepts/storages#working-with-datasets)** - store structured data where each object stored has the same attributes

## How it works

Insert your own code to `async with Actor:` block. You can use the [Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/) with any other Python library.
